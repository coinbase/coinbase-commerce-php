## PHP versions
PHP  version 5.4 and above are supported.

## Documentation
For more details visit [Coinbase API docs](https://commerce.coinbase.com/docs/api/).

To start using this library register an account on [Coinbase Commerce](https://commerce.coinbase.com/signup).
You will find your ``API_KEY`` from User Settings.

Next initialize a ``Client`` for interacting with the API. The only required parameter to initialize a client is ``apiKey``, however, you can also pass in ``baseUrl``, ``apiVersion``  and ``timeout``.
Parameters can be also be set post-initialization:
``` php
use CoinbaseCommerce\ApiClient;

//Make sure you don't store your API Key in your source code!
$apiClientObj = ApiClient::init(<API_KEY>);
$apiClientObj->setTimeout(3);
```

### Disable SSL Check
``` php
$apiClientObj->verifySsl(false);
```

The API resource class provides the following static methods: ``list, all, create, retrieve, updateById, deleteById``.  Additionally, the API resource class also provides the following instance methods: ``save, delete, insert, update``.

Each API method returns an ``ApiResource`` which represents the JSON response from the API.
When the response data is parsed into objects, the appropriate ``ApiResource`` subclass will automatically be used.

Client supports the handling of common API errors and warnings.
All errors that occur during any interaction with the API will be raised as exceptions.


| Error                        | Status Code |
|------------------------------|-------------|
| APIException                 |      *      |   
| InvalidRequestException      |     400     |   
| ParamRequiredException       |     400     |  
| ValidationException          |     400     |  
| AuthenticationException      |     401     |  
| ResourceNotFoundException    |     404     |
| RateLimitExceededException   |     429     |
| InternalServerException      |     500     |
| ServiceUnavailableException  |     503     |

## Events
[Events API Docs](https://commerce.coinbase.com/docs/api/#events)
More examples on how to use events can be found in the [`examples/Resources/EventExample.php`](examples/Resources/EventExample.php) file

## Warnings
It's prudent to be conscious of warnings. The library will log all warnings to a standard PSR-3 logger if one is configured.
``` php
use CoinbaseCommerce\ApiClient;

//Make sure you don't store your API Key in your source code!
$apiClientObj = ApiClient::init(<API_KEY>);
$apiClientObj->setLogger($logger);
```

## Webhooks
Coinbase Commerce signs the webhook events it sends to your endpoint, allowing you to validate and verify that they weren't sent by someone else.
You can find a simple example of how to use this with Express in the [`examples/Webhook`](examples/Webhook) folder
### Verify Signature header
``` php
use CoinbaseCommerce\Webhook;

try {
    Webhook::verifySignature($signature, $body, $sharedSecret);
    echo 'Successfully verified';
} catch (\Exception $exception) {
    echo $exception->getMessage();
    echo 'Failed';
}
```
